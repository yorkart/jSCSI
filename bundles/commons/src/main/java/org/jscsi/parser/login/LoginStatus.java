/**
 * <h1>LoginStatus</h1>
 * <p>
 * This enumeration contains only all defined Login Stati, which can send in a login response message in the iSCSI
 * Protocol (RFC3720).
 * <p>
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr>
 * <td>0</td>
 * <td>Success - indicates that the iSCSI target successfully received, understood, and accepted the request. The
 * numbering fields ( <code>StatSN</code>, <code>ExpCmdSN</code>, <code>MaxCmdSN</code>) are only valid if Status-Class
 * is <code>0</code>.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>1</td>
 * <td>Redirection - indicates that the initiator must take further action to complete the request. This is usually due
 * to the target moving to a different address. All of the redirection status class responses MUST return one or more
 * text key parameters of the type &quot;TargetAddress&quot;, which indicates the target's new address. A redirection
 * response MAY be issued by a target prior or after completing a security negotiation if a security negotiation is
 * required. A redirection SHOULD be accepted by an initiator even without having the target complete a security
 * negotiation if any security negotiation is required, and MUST be accepted by the initiator after the completion of
 * the security negotiation if any security negotiation is required.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td>Initiator Error (not a format error) - indicates that the initiator most likely caused the error. This MAY be due
 * to a request for a resource for which the initiator does not have permission. The request should not be tried again.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td>Target Error - indicates that the target sees no errors in the initiatorâ€™s Login Request, but is currently
 * incapable of fulfilling the request. The initiator may re-try the same Login Request later. The table below shows all
 * of the currently allocated status codes. The codes are in hexadecimal; the first byte is the status class and the
 * second byte is the status detail.</td>
