     * The ALLOCATION LENGTH field specifies the maximum number of bytes that an application client has allocated in the
     * Data-In Buffer. An allocation length of zero specifies that no data shall be transferred. This condition shall
     * not be considered as an error. The device server shall terminate transfers to the Data-In Buffer when the number
     * of bytes specified by the ALLOCATION LENGTH field have been transferred or when all available data have been
     * transferred, whichever is less.
     * <p>
     * The allocation length is used to limit the maximum amount of variable length data (e.g., mode data, log data,
     * diagnostic data) returned to an application client. If the information being transferred to the Data-In Buffer
     * includes fields containing counts of the number of bytes in some or all of the data, then the contents of these
     * fields shall not be altered to reflect the truncation, if any, that results from an insufficient ALLOCATION
     * LENGTH value, unless the standard that describes the Data-In Buffer format states otherwise.
     * <p>
     * If the amount of information to be transferred exceeds the maximum value that the ALLOCATION LENGTH field is
     * capable of specifying, the device server shall transfer no data and terminate the command with CHECK CONDITION
     * status, with the sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and the additional sense code set to INVALID FIELD IN CDB.
     * <p>
     * If EVPD is set to zero, the allocation length should be at least five, so that the ADDITIONAL LENGTH field in the
     * parameter data is returned. If EVPD is set to one, the allocation length should be should be at least four, so
     * that the PAGE LENGTH field in the parameter data is returned.
