 * This interface specifies methods for serializing an object. The serialized object can be inserted into an existing
 * {@link ByteBuffer} of sufficient size at an arbitrary position.
 * <p>
 * This interface is implemented by the classes representing sense and response data (as well as components thereof) to
 * SCSI requests, which are returned to the iSCSI initiator in the SCSI Response PDU's data segment.
 * <p>
 * Additional care must be taken when implementing objects consisting of several {@link ISerializable} components, not
 * to overwrite the fields of another component. The advantage of this strategy, however, will be higher speed, since
 * unnecessary buffer-to-buffer copying is avoided.
