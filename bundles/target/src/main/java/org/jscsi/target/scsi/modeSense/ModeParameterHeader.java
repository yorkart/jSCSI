     * the medium is not write-protected. When the software write protect (SWP) bit in the Control mode page (see SPC-4)
     * is set to one, the WP bit shall be set to one.

     * write-protected.

     * When used with the MODE SELECT command, the DPOFUA bit is reserved. When used with the MODE SENSE command, a
     * DPOFUA bit set to zero indicates that the device server does not support the DPO and FUA bits. When used with the
     * MODE SENSE command, a DPOFUA bit set to one indicates that the device server supports the DPO and FUA bits.
