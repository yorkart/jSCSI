/**
 * This class represents Command Descriptor Blocks for the <code>READ (6)
 * </code> SCSI command.
 * <p>
 * The READ (6) command requests that the device server read the specified logical block(s) and transfer them to the
 * data-in buffer. Each logical block read includes user data and, if the medium is formatted with protection
 * information enabled, protection information. Each logical block transferred includes user data but does not include
 * protection information.
 * <p>
 * Although the READ (6) command is limited to addressing up to 2,097,151 logical blocks, this command has been
 * maintained as mandatory since some system initialization routines require that the READ (6) command be used. System
 * initialization routines should migrate from the READ (6) command to the READ (10) command, which is capable of
 * addressing 4,294,947,295 logical blocks, or the READ (16) command, which is capable of addressing
 * 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 logical blocks.
