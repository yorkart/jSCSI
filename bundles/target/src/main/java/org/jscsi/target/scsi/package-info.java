 * one or more fields, which are used by SCSI devices to exchange information.
 * <p/>
 * The class and member variable names in the sub-packages usually match those of the represented SCSI elements and
 * fields, respectively. This means that additional information about the purpose and correct usage of these classes can
 * be found in either the <code>SCSI Architecture Model (SAM)</code> or one of the relevant command standards (
 * <code>SCSI PRIMARY COMMANDS (SPC)</code> and <code>SCSI BLOCK
 * COMMANDS (SBC)</code>), using the class name as a starting point.
 * <p/>
 * The following standards versions served as the basis for all classes from this package (some optional functionality
 * may have been omitted):
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>SAM-5 Revision 5</code></li>
 * <li><code>SPC-3 Revision 23</code></li>
 * <li><code>SBC-3 Revision 25</code></li>
